# hackers:
you may thing hackers are those people people on you youtube who claims to hacking facebook or any other social media but that not the truth, **the truth** is the real hackers wants stay **hidden** the last person you would thing of. So what are the types of hackers
## types of hackers:
they many types of hackers but the most famous ones are:
* white hat **the good group**

* black hat **the bad group**

* grey hat **the harmless group**

* terrorist **cause of terrorism**

* hacktivist **political reasons**
    * **anonymous**

# operating system (OS)
there are a lot of operating systems for different goals but the most popullar ones are:
* windows

* os x

* linux

now you're must be wondering what operating system hackers use? And the answer is they use linux for a lot of reasons some of them are:
* linux made with privacy in mind
* all of hacking if not most of tools were made for linux
* linux is free and open source that it devoloped by its community as we say **from community to the community**
## linux has a lot of distributions each distribution made for different type of users:

1. distributions for regular users and new users:
    * linux limnt

    * ubuntu 


    * manjaro linux


    * pop os

2. distributions for expert and developers:
    * arch linux

    * debian linux
    
3. distributions for hackers

    * kali linux

    * blackarch linux
    
    * parrot os

so what really make those distributions or you call them distros unique:

distros like ubuntu was made from debian linux we ubunutu based on **debian** (it debian linux with extra feature)

pop os, linux limnt are based on **ubuntu** which makes everything easyer to someone who just swicth from windows

manjaro is based on **arch linux**

if you are good and have experience with linux i think you should try one of those:
* debian the most stable linux each major update takes up to 1 years to make sure it's stable and compatble with every computers 

* arch linux it a rolling distro, that each day new update i don't mean the whole os but the programms will stay at bleeding edge, wow that great but sometimes the major update came and it's not really working on your machine that really normal for arch 

## hacking distro:
kali linux parrot os based debian basically the same
blackarch is different
* based on arch
* blackarch has about 2500 hacking tools 

# hacking
hacking is getting access to something you shouldn't have without leaving a trace

## types of attacks 
* reverse engineering:
    * radare2
    * hopper
    * ghidra
    * binary ninja

* gathering informations or (exploiting):
    * seaching for weakness
    * searchsploit search for vulnerabilities
    * [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/)
    * [google dorking](https://google.com/)

* network:
    * nmap scanning a sever/website 
    * gobuster search for hidden directories

* passcracking (**brute forcing** or **dictionary attack**):
    * john the ripper (offline)
    * hashcat (offline)
    * hydra (online)
